## 🚀 About Me

Hey there, I’m Dario—a full-stack technologist with a mission to build smarter, more beautiful, and forward-thinking software. With over 15 years of experience, I specialize in cloud-native SaaS platforms, AI integrations, and next-gen web interfaces that blur the lines between design and code.

From microservices to machine learning and immersive 3D experiences, I thrive where complexity meets creativity. Whether I’m leading architecture or rolling up my sleeves to prototype cutting-edge features, I build with precision, passion, and purpose.
